# FinalProject
In this folder, you will find all the resources necessary to view my capstone data project. Please see the screenshot photographs to view different queries and tables demonstrating the functionality of the database. If you are unable to view the notebook, below is the HTML file version.

While my database is certainly far from perfection, I have learned so much especially through this project. It has opened the door to the cloud space, and I look forward to using databricks/Azure/ other cloud deployments in the future. These platforms are incredibly powerful, and it was exciting to work on a project in this space.
